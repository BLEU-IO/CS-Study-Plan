# Schedule - For Hardcore Software Engineers
This schedule is for nerds who want to challenge themselves and push boundaries. This schedule *till now* is a bit toxic and unrealistic, but it's just a deadline which will be altered over the time; We're still figuring it out.

# Cultivating a Successful BLEU Lifestyle

### Learning Queue
- **Plan Your Learning**: Treat learning as a part of your daily routine. Each week, set clear, achievable goals, breaking down course content into bite-sized tasks. Dedicate focused blocks of time for lectures, readings, and hands-on practice.
- **Resource Review**: Before each weekly sync-up, dive into the materials. Annotate, highlight key concepts, and pinpoint areas where you need more clarity. This proactive approach ensures you're prepared to maximize your learning sessions.

### Project Queue
- **Build Continuously**: Embrace a project-oriented mindset. Keep a rolling list of projects aligned with your interests and career goals. Continuously building alongside the curriculum not only sharpens your skills but also bridges the gap between theory and practice.
- **Use Version Control**: Adopt version control, such as Git, as a non-negotiable part of your workflow. This not only tracks your project's evolution but also simplifies collaboration and enables you to recover from mistakes effortlessly.
- **Document & Share**: Keep a detailed development log. Reflect on your progress, note the challenges, and document your solutions. Sharing this journey with the community not only helps others but also solidifies your own learning.

### Problem-Solving Queue
- **Consistency is Key**: Just like a real developer, make problem-solving a daily habit. Regularly engage with coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank. This consistent practice builds your problem-solving muscle, crucial for a developer's toolkit.
- **Explore Multiple Solutions**: Don’t settle for the first solution that works. Experiment with different approaches, and critically assess their efficiency and trade-offs. This exploration mirrors the real-world scenarios you'll face as a developer.

### Discussion
- **Active Participation**: Come prepared to your weekly group discussions. Bring questions that stem from your learning and project experiences, and be ready to share insights. Engaging deeply with your peers is a hallmark of a successful developer.
- **Diverse Perspectives**: A real developer knows the value of multiple viewpoints. Listen to your peers, challenge ideas constructively, and collaborate to deepen your understanding of the material.

### Building in Public & Helping Others
- **Open-Source Your Work**: Embrace the spirit of open source. Share your projects on GitHub, contributing to a wider community. Building in public not only showcases your work but also invites feedback and collaboration.
- **Contribute to the Community**: Take an active role in the BLEU community. Help others by answering questions, sharing your experiences, and mentoring peers. In doing so, you reinforce your own knowledge and build lasting connections.
  
### Join the Conversation
